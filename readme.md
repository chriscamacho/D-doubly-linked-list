dList (doubly linked list) 
 
The class is a template meaning that all nodes contain
the same type of data pointers
 
The list can be iterated forward and backwards.  
It can be sorted using a quick sort algorith, 
the sort must be given a callback function so it can compare the
"value" of your data type.  
Nodes can be added, inserted and deleted.
Searching for a node containing a particular pointer is
by brute force.
Callbacks can optionally be used for iterating
